\subsection{Potential drivers of the increase in corruption tolerance}
As pointed out previously, the corruption tolerance increase happened at the same time as other key events. First, AB indicators denote a political crisis, as support for President Rafael Correa's regime took a sharp hit. Second, a recession hit Ecuador due to a commodity price collapse, an earthquake and other circumstances. Below, Figure \ref{fig:ecua_pol} shows several public opinion indicators and Figure \ref{fig:ecua_ec} displays economic conditions, both observed and perceived from 2014 to 2019. 

% Create the data to be used for the political opinion variables:
<<political-graph-data, cache = T>>=

# Wrangle the time series of confidence in the president

political_graph_df<-
  pconf_time %>%
  select(year, 
         pres_conf_dicYes, 
         se.pres_conf_dicYes) %>% 
  rename(perc = pres_conf_dicYes, 
         se = se.pres_conf_dicYes) %>% 
  mutate(legend = '% who confide in the President') %>% 
  filter(year != 2004, 
         year != 2006)

# The same but for the job approval rating variable

japrov_df_g<-
  japrov_time %>%
  select(year, 
         pres_aprov_dicYes, 
         se.pres_aprov_dicYes) %>% 
  rename(perc = pres_aprov_dicYes,
         se = se.pres_aprov_dicYes) %>% 
  mutate(legend = '% who approve the President\'s job performance')

# Same for leftists and rightists

leftists_df_g<-
  leftist_time %>%
  rename(perc = leftist) %>%
  mutate(legend = '% who identiy with the political left')
    

rightists_df_g<-
  rightist_time %>% 
  rename(perc = rightist) %>% 
  mutate(legend = '% who identiy with the political right')

# Now unite all of these in the same dataframe to plot it. 

political_graph_df<-
  bind_rows(political_graph_df,

The AB data shows that indeed the President reached an all-time high popularity in 2014 and then a severe drop in 2016. This is seen through the percent of people who approve the President's job performance and the percent who report confidence in him. Another notable change in the political landscape is the way that voting-age population politically identified. There was a strong increase of the people who identified as the \enquote{right}, while those who identified with the \enquote{left} did not see significant changes.

Regarding the economic recession, \textcite{Orozco.2015} holds that although the commodity price collapse in 2008 was greater, there was little reduction in economic activity as the country had greater possibilities of international financing and savings left over from past oil funds, which were used to keep government expenditure high. In 2016, as savings eroded and government debt had grown bigger, the economy stagnated significantly for the first time in the Correa administration. Combined with the lack of competitiveness in exports due to US dollar appreciations and the poor public finance administration \parencite{Hurtado.2018}, the country fell into a deep economic recession. While the official GDP figures may show only a small reduction in GDP growth, \textcite{Hurtado.2018} holds that these figures are overestimated.
